// Streaming rules can be used within services to process incoming requests in the background.
// In this example, the incoming requests are fed into a global stream. If the number of requests from
// the same host is greater than six within 10 seconds, a log is printed. This example can be extended to make
// decisions based on the output of the streaming rules.
