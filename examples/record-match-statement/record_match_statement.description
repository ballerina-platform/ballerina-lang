// The match statement in Ballerina will support value based match patterns only. There are static and structured
// based match patterns that can be used with the match clauses. Structured match patterns will take structured
// binding patterns for matching. Record binding pattern is one of the structured binding patterns that can be used
// with the match. The value will be checked for "isLike" relationship with the pattern to match at runtime.
// The match pattern clauses can also have additional type guard conditions as strong match conditions.
