// Channel is a constrained type that can be defined only as a top level node.
// It is introduced for communication between parallel processes in Ballerina programs.
// Channels can be used for message correlation by sending and receiving messages via different resources to the same channel.
// In workflow related scenarios, you can use channels to receive intermediate input.
