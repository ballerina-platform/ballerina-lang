// You can configure resources of HTTP services to restrict the types of media they consume and produce.
// This is done through the 'consumes' and 'produces' annotation attributes of the ResourceConfig annotation, which is used with resources.<br/><br/>
// For more information on the underlying module, 
// see the [HTTP module](https://ballerina.io/learn/api-docs/ballerina/http/index.html).
