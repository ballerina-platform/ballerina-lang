// The gRPC Server Connector is used to expose gRPC services over HTTP/2.
// This sample includes a gRPC client streaming service and non-blocking client. The client writes a sequence of messages and sends them to the server via a stream. 
// Once the client has finished writing the messages, it waits for the server to read them and return a response.
