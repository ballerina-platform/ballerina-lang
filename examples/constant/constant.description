// Constants are compile time known values. Only value type constants (boolean, byte, decimal, float, int, string)
// are supported at the moment. The constants are useful for defining enumeration types.
//
// We can use these constants just like any other value type variable except the value of these constants cannot be
// changed after initializing. The difference between the final variables and constants is that the value of the final
// variables can be initialized at runtime. But constants must be initialized at compile time.
