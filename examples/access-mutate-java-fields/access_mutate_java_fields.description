// Java fields (both static and instance) can be read and updated in Ballerina.
// From the Ballerina side, they will appear as function calls. This example shows how to read a field value.
// Similarly, the `@java:FieldSet` annotation can be used to create a Ballerina function with
// an external function that acts as a field setter.
