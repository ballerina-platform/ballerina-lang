// Task Appointment Services are used to schedule and execute tasks.
// An appointment should have an `appointmentData` field. It can be either a
// `string` representing a cron expression or an `AppointmentData` record.
// An optional `noOfRecurrences` field can be used to provide the maximum
// number of times the appointment should run before shutdown.
