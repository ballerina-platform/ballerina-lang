// Ballerina is designed to ensure that programs written with Ballerina are inherently secure. Ballerina programs
// are resilient to major security vulnerabilities including SQL injection, path manipulation, file manipulation,
// unauthorized file access, and unvalidated redirect (open redirect).
//
// A taint analysis mechanism is used to achieve this. As a result of the taint analysis mechanism, the Ballerina compiler
// identifies untrusted (tainted) data by observing how tainted data propagates through the program. If untrusted data
// is passed to a security sensitive parameter, a compiler error is generated.
