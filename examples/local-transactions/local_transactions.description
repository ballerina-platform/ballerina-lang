// A Ballerina transaction is a series of data manipulation statements 
// that must either fully complete or fully fail, thereby leaving the
// system in a consistent state. This sample uses H2 database, which is 
// created when running the sample. Prior to running this sample, 
// change the DB connection properties as required.
// Ballerina transactions are at experimental stage,
// please use  --experimental flag to enable them.
