// Ballerina users can configure multiple backends in a given failover config. 
// If the client looses the connection by the server being shut down or by getting any IOExceptions, 
// Ballerina automatically tries to connect with the remaining backends that are specified in the configuration. 
// The trying happens only once for each of the backends.<br/><br/>
// For more information on the underlying module, 
// see the [HTTP module](https://ballerina.io/learn/api-docs/ballerina/http/index.html).
