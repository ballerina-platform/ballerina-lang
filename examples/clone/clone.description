// Clone built-in method is used to make a copy of any anydata value.
// `anydata` is a union equivalent to boolean|int|float|decimal|string|xml|table|anydata[]|map<anydata>.
// Clone is defined on all structured types but returns an error if the value is not anydata.
// The resultant copy will be a deep copy.
// A deep copy copies all fields, and makes copies of dynamically allocated memory pointed to by the fields.
// It preserves cycles, it preserves the storage type, and it preserves immutability
