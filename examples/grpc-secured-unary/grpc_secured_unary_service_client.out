# Create a Ballerina project and a module inside it.
# Copy generated stub file `grpc_secured_unary_pb.bal` to the module.
# For example, if you create a module named `client`, copy the stub file to the `client` module.

# Add new Ballerina file `grpc_secured_unary_client.bal` inside the `client` module and add client implementation.

# Execute the following command to build the 'client' module.
$ ballerina build client

# Run the client using the following command and passing Ballerina home path as system property.
$ ballerina run target/bin/client.jar --b7a.home=<ballerina_home_path>
