// Object mocking enables controlling the values of member variables and the behavior of
// the member functions of an object. Mocking of objects can be done in two ways. <br/><br/>
// 1. Creating a test double - providing an equivalent mock object in place of the real<br/>
// 2. Stubbing the member function or member variable - stubbing the behavior of functions
// and values of the variables<br/><br/>
// Creating a test double is suitable when a single mock function/object can be used
// throughout all tests whereas stubbing is ideal when defining different behaviors for
// different test cases is required.<br/><br/>
