# To run this sample, navigate to the directory that contains the
# `.bal` file, and execute the `ballerina run` command.
# When you start the subscriber after publishing several messages,
# You'll notice that,
# 1. `receiveSinceTimeDelta` service receives the messages if
#     the messages were sent within a historical offset of 5 seconds
#     from the current server date/time
# 2. `receiveFromGivenIndex` service receives services messages
#     starting from the third message published.
# 3. `receiveFromLastReceived` service receives messages starting
#     from the last published message.
# 4. `receiveFromBeginning` service receives all messages ever
#     published
# 5. `receiveNewOnly` service receives only the messages, which are
#    published after the subscriber starts.
