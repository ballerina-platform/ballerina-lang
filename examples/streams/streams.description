// The `stream` type represents a sequence that may be constructed lazily
// and is used to iterate over the sequence of values of type T with error type E.
// `stream<T>` is short for `stream<T, never>`.
// A stream can be iterated over at most once.
// A stream has a `next()` method; a stream's iterator works by calling this method.
// The stream type provides methods similar to lists such as `map`, `foreach`, `filter`, `reduce`, and `iterator`.
// The stream type does not provide a length method.
