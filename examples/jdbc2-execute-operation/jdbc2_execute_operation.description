// This example demonstrates how to use the JDBC client with DDL and DML operations.
// Note that the relevant database driver JAR
//should be placed in the `BALLERINA_HOME/bre/lib` folder. However, this sample is based on an
//H2 database and the H2 database driver JAR is included by default into the Ballerina distribution.
//Therefore, it is not required to copy the driver JAR for H2 databases.
