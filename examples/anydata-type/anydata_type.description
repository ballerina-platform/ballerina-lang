// The `anydata` type is a sub set of type `any` of the Ballerina data types. The `anydata` type is defined by the
// following union: boolean | int | float | decimal | string | xml | table | anydata[] | map<anydata> | ().
// When you do not have prior knowledge of the data type of your variable, you can assign `anydata` as the type.
// Values of these variables can come from dynamic content such as the request and response message fields and the user input.
// The `anydata` type allows you to skip compile-time data type checks.
