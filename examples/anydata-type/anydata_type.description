// The `anydata` type consists of pure values whose basic type is not `error`. Thus, the `anydata` type is
// equivalent to `()|boolean|int|float|decimal|string|(anydata|error)[]|map<anydata|error>|xml|table`.
// Although `json` and `byte` are not explicitly mentioned, they are subsets of the aforementioned union.
// The same is true for records of which all the field types are subsets of `anydata`(including the rest field in open records).
// `anydata` variables can be used in places where you expect pure values (sans `error`).
