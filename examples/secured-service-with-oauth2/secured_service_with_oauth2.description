// A service can be secured using OAuth2 and optionally by enforcing
// authorization. The OAuth2 auth provider verifies the token against the
// configured introspection server. The result returned from the introspection
// server is used for token expiration, authorization etc.
// Ballerina uses the concept of scopes for authorization. A resource declared
// in a service can be bound to one/more scope(s). The scopes are included in
// the introspection response and the scopes of the resource are compared
// against those for at least one match between the two sets.
