# Create a Ballerina project and a package inside it.
# Add grpc_server_streaming.bal file inside the package directory and
# build the project.
# For example, if you create a package named 'service', execute the following command to build
# the 'service' package.
$ ballerina build service

# Once you build the project, following files will be generated inside target directory.
# * service.balx
# * grpc/HelloWorld.proto

# Run the service using the following command.
$ ballerina run target/service.balx
