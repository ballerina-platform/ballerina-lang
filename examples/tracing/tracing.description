// Ballerina supports Observability out of the box, and Tracing is one of the three important aspect of the
// Observability. To observe Ballerina code, the '--b7a.observability.enabled=true' property should be given when starting the service.
// The developers can trace their code blocks and measure the time incurred during the actual runtime execution.
// They can choose the hook their measurement with the default trace created or can create a completely new trace.<br/><br/>
