// Ballerina supports the `.stamp()` built-in method to change the storage type of a value to a specified type
// by mutating the value.
// Stamps can only be used with `anydata`-typed values.
// If successful, a stamp attempt returns the value itself with the type changed to the stamped type.
// If a stamp attempt fails due to an incompatible type being specified or a non-`anydata` value being present, an
// error is returned.
