// A worker can be used to handle background tasks of an application.
// Workers interact with each other by sending messages. 
// Messages are sent over a communication channel, which is transparent to the user.
// Worker sync send waits until the message is delivered.
// FLush can be used to check if all messages are successfully sent to a given worker.
// Both sync send and flush may fail if a receiving worker returned and error before receiving the messages.
// Similarly they may panic if a receiver panicked.
