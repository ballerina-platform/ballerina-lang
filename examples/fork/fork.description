// In a function execution, a fork block splits the current execution to multiple workers, which do their work in parallel.
// The `fork` block allows you to start any number of parallel workers at once. Workers are visible outside the fork block as futures. 
// These futures behave similar to the futures returned by asynchronous functions created by `start`. You may wait for the worker 
// returns using `wait` expression.
// You may also send `anydata` variables form one fork worker to another worker in the same fork.
