// The `fork` block allows you to start any number of workers simultaneously. Workers are visible outside the fork block as futures.
// These futures behave similar to the futures returned by asynchronous functions created by `start`. You may wait until the worker 
// finishes by using the `wait` expression.
// You can only send `anydata` variables from a worker of one fork to another worker in the same fork.
