// Constants are values known at compile time. As of now only value type constants i.e., constants of `boolean`, `byte`,
// `decimal`, `float`, `int` and `string` types) are supported. Constants are useful for defining enumeration types.
//
// We can use these constants just like any other value type variable except the value of these constants cannot be
// changed after initializing. The difference between the final variables and constants is that the value of the final
// variables can be initialized at runtime. However, constants must be initialized at compile time.
