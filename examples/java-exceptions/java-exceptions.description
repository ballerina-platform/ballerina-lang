// In idiomatic Ballerina code, errors should be communicated via explicit return values in functions.
// Java error handling is different from Ballerina. Java constructors and methods throw both
// checked and unchecked exceptions. In Java interoperability design, if a Java method throws an
// unchecked exception then the corresponding Ballerina function invocation panics.
// A panic indicates abnormal completions and usually implies that something unexpected has occurred.
// If a Java method throws a checked exception, then the corresponding Ballerina function
// should have the `error` type in its return signature.
// Let's look at how to handle Java exceptions in Ballerina.
