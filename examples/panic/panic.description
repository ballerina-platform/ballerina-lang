// In Ballerina, panic indicates abnormal completions, and usually implies that something unexpected has occurred
// (i.e., something that should not have occurred during the normal operation). A panic causes
// the call stack to unwind until it is trapped.
//
// Ballerina discourages the use of `panic` to handle program-related
// errors such as `header not found`, `data mismatch` errors, etc.). However,
// `panic` can be used in scenarios such as `Connection Closed/Timeout` and `OutOfMemory`
// in which the program cannot handle the error by itself.
