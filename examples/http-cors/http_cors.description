//This sample demonstrates the Ballerina server connector CORS configuration. 
//CORS headers can be applied in both the service-level and the resource-level. Service-level CORS headers apply to all the resources
//unless there are headers configured at the resource-level. Ballerina CORS supports both simple and pre-flight requests.<br/><br/>
// For more information on the underlying module, 
// see the [HTTP module](https://ballerina.io/learn/api-docs/ballerina/http/index.html).
