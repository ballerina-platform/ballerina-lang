// The `.convert()` built-in method creates a new value with a target storage type from a given `anydata`-typed
// value, and assigns it to a target variable.
// Conversion attempts could be safe or unsafe. Unsafe conversion attempts could return an `error`.
// `.convert()` is defined on all structured types, but returns an error if the value is not of the type `anydata`.
