# This sample requires the Hub Service to start via the hub.bal file, prior to running the Publisher main program. The
# Subscriber Service needs to start after the publisher registers the topic at the hub.
# If the port is not specified, the hub service starts on the default port.
# To run this sample, navigate to the directory that contains the
# `.bal` file, and execute the `ballerina run` command.
$ ballerina run hub.bal
