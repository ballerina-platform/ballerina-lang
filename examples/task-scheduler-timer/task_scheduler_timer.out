// A `Person` record is attached to the Scheduler when attaching the service.
// It is then passed into the resource functions of the service.
// When the `age` of the `person` reaches the `maxAge`, while loop is returned.
// Hence the task is stopped.
# To run this sample, navigate to the directory that contains the
# `.bal` file and issue the `ballerina run` command.
