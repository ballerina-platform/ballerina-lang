# Testerina

Testerina is the test framework built for the Ballerina language.

## How to run

This will be a part of Ballerina distribution.  
For the time being, you can copy the built ```testerina-core-0.8.0-SNAPSHOT.jar```  
file to ```<ballerina_home>/bre/lib``` and test.  

To test a file written in Ballerina language use the test command as follows.

```./ballerina test <test_bal_file>```

Your test file should contain ```_test.bal``` prefix.
