# The Ballerina Programming Language

Ballerina is an open source programming language and platform for cloud-era application programmers to easily write software that just works.

#### Providing and consuming services
It has inherently concurrent first-class language constructs for providing and consuming services.

#### Sequence diagrams
Sequence diagram based graphical view shows the most fundamental aspect of the semantics of a network distributed application.

#### Structural typing
It allows for looser coupling between distributed components and eliminates the friction of data binding.

#### Metadata
Extensible metadata enables easy integration of Ballerina programs with cloud platforms.
