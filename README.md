# The Ballerina programming language

[Ballerina](https://ballerina.io/) is a statically typed, open-source cloud-native programming language developed
and supported by [WSO2](https://wso2.com/).

With Ballerina, you could easily develop microservices, API endpoints and integrations,
and any other application for the cloud. Additionally, Ballerina has all the general-purpose
functionalities you could expect from a modern programming language.

With Ballerina's compiler-level built-in support for widely used data types such
as JSON and XML, your focus on handling structured data, network service interactions,
and dealing with concurrency is made much more effective.

#### Providing and consuming services
It has inherently concurrent first-class language constructs for providing and consuming services.

#### Sequence diagrams
Sequence diagram based graphical view shows the most fundamental aspect of the semantics of a network distributed application.

#### Structural typing
It allows for looser coupling between distributed components and eliminates the friction of data binding.

#### Metadata
Extensible metadata enables easy integration of Ballerina programs with cloud platforms.
You could directly generate Docker and Kubernetes artifacts straight away from
the source code.
