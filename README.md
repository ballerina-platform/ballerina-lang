# The Ballerina programming language

[Ballerina](https://ballerina.io/) is an open-source cloud-native programming language optimized for integration. It is developed and supported by [WSO2](https://wso2.com/).

With Ballerina, you could easily develop microservices, API endpoints and integrations,
and any other application for the cloud. Additionally, Ballerina has all the general-purpose
functionalities you could expect from a modern programming language.

With Ballerina's compiler-level built-in support for widely used data types such
as JSON and XML, your focus on handling structured data, network service interactions,
and dealing with concurrency is made much more effective.

#### Providing and consuming services

It has inherently concurrent first-class language constructs for providing and consuming services.

#### Low code and pro code support

Ballerina allows seamless switching between low-code and pro-code, enabling visual design with optional custom coding.

#### Structural typing

It allows for looser coupling between distributed components and eliminates the friction of data binding.

#### Metadata

Extensible metadata enables easy integration of Ballerina programs with cloud platforms.
You could directly generate Docker and Kubernetes artifacts straight away from
the source code.
