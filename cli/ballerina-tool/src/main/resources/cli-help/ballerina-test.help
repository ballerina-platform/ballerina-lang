NAME
       ballerina-test - Run package tests

SYNOPSIS
       ballerina test [<options>]
                      [<ballerina-file-path> | <ballerina-project-directory>] [<config properties>]


DESCRIPTION
       Test compiles and executes Ballerina test sources and prints a summary of
       test results. You can execute tests in a Ballerina package or a standalone
       Ballerina file.
    
       Use 'ballerina test to execute tests in the current package.

       Use 'ballerina test <balfile>' to execute the given Ballerina test file.
              Note that testing single BAL files will not work within a Ballerina project.
              File path can be relative or absolute.


OPTIONS
       --offline
           When building a package, the remote repository (Ballerina Central) is
           always checked for latest artifacts of the dependencies. If the
           '--offline' option is specified, this remote check is not done and
           the local artifacts will be used instead.

       --list-groups
           Lists the test groups available in the test files. Groups are
           tags that are added to test functions. They are used to
           control the execution of test functions by specifying a
           group or a set of groups that need to be executed in a test
           run. A test function can be grouped using the 'groups' parameter within the
           '@test:Config' annotation.

       --groups <test_group, ...>
           Specifies the test groups to be executed. Groups are tags that are
           added to test functions. They are used to control the
           execution of test functions by specifying a group or a set of
           groups that need to be executed in a test run. A test
           function can be grouped using the 'groups' parameter within the
           '@test:Config' annotation.

       --disable-groups <test_group, ...>
           Specifies the test groups to be excluded. Groups are tags that are
           added to test functions. They are used to control the
           execution of test functions by specifying a group or a set of
           groups that need to be executed in a test run. A test
           function can be grouped using the 'groups' parameter within the
           '@test:Config' annotation.

       --tests <test_function_name, ...>
            Specifies the test functions to be executed. A specific set of
            test functions can be executed using this command.

       --rerun-failed
            Executes only the previously-failed test cases in the package.

       --code-coverage
           Enables code coverage. This will analyze the line coverage of
           source .bal files in the Ballerina project and add a section
           to the testerina report with code coverage details.
           This feature is not supported with single file executions.

       --test-report
           Generates an HTML report containing test results. Defaults to 'true'
           if code coverage is enabled.

       --experimental
           Enable experimental language features.

       --debug
           Run tests in remote debugging mode.

       --observability-included
           Package observability in the executable.

CONFIG PROPERTIES
       (--key=value)...
           Set the Ballerina environment parameters as key/value pairs.
           If multiple parameters need to be provided, each parameter
           has to be prefixed with '--'. Details of the environment parameters
           supported by the Ballerina standard library packages are specified
           in the relevant API documentation.


EXAMPLES
        Run all tests in the current package.
           $ ballerina test

        List all test groups in the package.
           $ ballerina test --list-groups

        Run only the set of tests belonging to the `group_x` in the current package.
           $ ballerina test --groups group_x

        Run only the given set of functions in the current package.
            $ ballerina test --tests testFunction

        Run only the previously-failed test cases in the current package.
            $ ballerina test --rerun-failed

        Run tests in a single BAL file.
           $ ballerina test main_test.bal

        Run tests and generate a test report.
           $ ballerina test --test-report

        Run tests with code coverage. This will generate a test report
        with test statuses and code coverage information.
           $ ballerina test --code-coverage
