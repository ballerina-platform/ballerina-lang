NAME
       bal persist - Manage data persistence

SYNOPSIS
       bal persist <command> [<-h> | <--help>]

DESCRIPTION
       Manage data persistence in a Ballerina package.

       Initializing the package for persistence is the first step towards achieving
       data persistence in a Ballerina package. This step creates the required
       directories and configuration files.
       For example:

           $ bal persist init

       Defining the application's data model is the next step. Use the generated
       definition file in the `persist` directory to define the data model
       with the domain-specific entities. Use the standard Ballerina record type
       definitions to represent the entities and their relationships.
       For example:

           type Department record {|
               readonly string deptNo;
               string deptName;
               Employee[] employees;
           |};

           type Employee record {|
               readonly string empNo;
               string firstName;
               string lastName;
               Department department;
           |};

       Then, generate the client API and SQL script based on the data model. Use the generated
       API to query and manipulate the persistent data in the application and use the generated
       SQL script to create the database tables.
       For example:

       $ bal persist generate
