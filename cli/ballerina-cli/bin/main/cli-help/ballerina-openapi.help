DESCRIPTION
       Generate a Ballerina source (either a mock service or a client stub) from
       the given OpenAPI definition file or export an OpenAPI definition from a
       Ballerina service.
    
       The generated Ballerina sources will be written into the provided output
       location.


OPTIONS
       -i, --input <openapi-contract-file-path | ballerina-service-file-path>
            This is a mandatory input. The given OpenAPI contract input will
            generate a Ballerina service and the client stub files for the given
            OpenAPI contract. This generated service can be used as a code
            template to start the service implementation. Generated sources
            contain a service definition, schema definition, and a copy of the
            OpenAPI contract, which is used for the template generation.
            The generated client stub is used to start the client application
            implementation to call the service defined in the OpenAPI file.
            The given Ballerina service file input will generate the relevant
            OpenAPI specification for the service file.

        -o, --output <output>
            Location of the generated Ballerina source code. If this path is not
            specified, the output will be written to the same directory from
            which the command is run.

        --mode <mode-type>
            Mode type can be 'service' or 'client'. The Ballerina service and
            client will be generated according to the specified mode.

        -n, --nullable
            JSON schema properties that are not marked as `nullable:true` may
            return as null in some responses. It will result in a JSON schema to
            Ballerina record data binding error. This is a safe option to
            generate all data types in the record with Ballerina nil support.

        --license <license-file-path>
            Optional. The `.bal` files will generate with the given copyright or
            license header.

        -s, --service <current-service-name>
            This service name is used to identify the service that needs to
            documented as OpenApi specification. This option is used with the
            command of Ballerina to OpenAPI specification generation.

        --json
            Generate the Ballerina service to OpenAPI output in JSON.
            The default is YAML.

        --tags <tag-names>
            These tags are used to filter the operations tags that are needed to
            generate services. This option is used with the OpenAPI to Ballerina
            file generation command.

        --operations <operation-names>
            List of operations to generate the Ballerina service or client.

        --with-tests
            Work with the client generation command and generate a test
            boiler-plate for all the remote functions of the generated client.

        --client-methods <resource|remote>
            This option can be used in client generation to select the client method type, which can be `resource` or `remote`. (The default option is `remote`).

EXAMPLES
       Generate a Ballerina mock service using a `hello.yaml` OpenAPI contract.
           $ bal openapi -i hello.yaml --mode service

       Generate a Ballerina client using a `hello.yaml` OpenAPI contract.
           $ bal openapi -i hello.yaml --mode client

       Generate a Ballerina client including boiler-plate test cases for all the
       client remote functions based on the `hello.yaml` OpenAPI contract.
           $ bal openapi -i hello.yaml --mode client --with-tests

       Generate both the Ballerina client and service files using a `hello.yaml`
       OpenAPI contract and (optionally) write the output to the given
       directory.
          $ bal openapi --input hello.yaml -o ./output_path

       Generate services for the tags given in the `hello.yaml` OpenAPI
       contract.
           $ bal openapi -i hello.yaml --mode service --tags tag_ID

       Generate services for the operations given in the `hello.yaml` OpenAPI
       contract.
           $ bal openapi -i hello.yaml --mode service --operations operation_ID

       Generate all the record fields that are not specifically mentioned as
       `nullable:false` in the OpenAPI schema property as nullable.
           $ bal openapi -i hello.yaml --nullable

       Generate both the Ballerina client and service files including the given
       license or copyright header.
           $ bal openapi -i hello.yaml --license license.txt

       Generate a client with resource methods with respect to the `hello.yaml` OpenAPI contract.
           $ bal openapi -i hello.yaml --client-methods resource
           $ bal openapi -i hello.yaml --mode client --client-methods resource

       Export an OpenAPI definition for the `/hello` service of the
       `hello_service.bal` file.
           $ bal openapi -i hello_service.bal --service-name /hello

       Generate an OpenAPI specification in the JSON format.
           $ bal openapi -i hello_service.bal --json
