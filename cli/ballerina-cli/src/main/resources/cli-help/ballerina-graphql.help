NAME
       ballerina-graphql - Generate the Ballerina client sources for a GraphQL config file, 
       generate the GraphQL schema for a Ballerina GraphQL service,
       and generate the Ballerina service sources for a GraphQL schema.


SYNOPSIS
       bal graphql [-i | --input] <graphql-configuration-file-path>
                   [-o | --output] <output-location>
       bal graphql [-i | --input] <ballerina-graphql-service-file-path>
                   [-o | --output] <output-location>
                   [-s | --service] <service-base-path>
       bal graphql [-i | --input] <graphql-schema-file-path>
                   [-o | --output] <output-location>
                   [-m | --mode] <operation-mode>
                   [-r | --use-records-for-objects]


DESCRIPTION
       Generate the Ballerina GraphQL client sources for a given GraphQL config file configured
       with GraphQL schemas specified by GraphQL Schema Definition Language(SDL) and GraphQL
       queries or export a GraphQL schema (SDL) for a given Ballerina GraphQL service.
    
       The generated Ballerina sources or GraphQL schema files will be written into the provided
       output location.


OPTIONS
        -i, --input <graphql-configuration-file-path | ballerina-graphql-service-file-path | 
        graphql-schema-file-path>
            This is mandatory input. The given GraphQL config file which is configured with
            GraphQL schemas (SDL) and queries, will generate the Ballerina GraphQL client sources.
            The given Ballerina GraphQL service file will generate the GraphQL schema (SDL) file
            relevant to the service.
            The given GraphQL schema file will generate the Ballerina GraphQL service sources.
        -o, --output <output-location>
            Location of the generated Ballerina source code or GraphQL schema. If this path is not
            specified, the output will be written to the same directory from which the command is
            run.
        -s, --service <service-base-path>
            This service base path is used to identify the service that needs to generate the
            GraphQL schema. This option is used with the GraphQL schema generation command.
            If this base path is not specified, schemas will be generated for each of the GraphQL
            services in the input file.
        -m, --mode
            This mode is used to identify the operation mode. It can be `client`, `schema`, or 
            `service`. The `client` argument indicates the Ballerina client source code 
            generation, the `schema` argument indicates the GraphQL schema generation, and the 
            `service` argument indicates the Ballerina GraphQL service source code generation. 
            If the `mode` flag is not specified, the `graphql` tool will infer the mode from the 
            `input` file extension.
        -r, --use-records-for-objects
            This flag is used without an argument. It is used only in the Ballerina GraphQL 
            service generation. It will make the Ballerina CLI tool to use record types for 
            GraphQL object types whenever possible.

EXAMPLES
       Generate Ballerina Graphql clients using a GraphQL config file (`graphql.config.yaml`).
           $ bal graphql -i graphql.config.yaml

       Generate Ballerina Graphql clients using a GraphQL config file (`graphql.config.yaml`) 
       and write the output to the given directory.
           $ bal graphql -i graphql.config.yaml -o ./output_path

       Generate a GraphQL schema for a selected GraphQL service from the given input file.
           $ bal graphql -i graphql_service.bal -o ./output_path -s /service_base_path

       Generate a Ballerina GraphQL service using a GraphQL schema file (`schema.graphql`).
           $ bal graphql -i schema.graphql -m service -o ./output_path

       Generate a Ballerina GraphQL service using a GraphQL schema file (`schema.graphql`) 
       including record types whenever possible.
           $ bal graphql -i schema.graphql -m service -o ./output_path -r
