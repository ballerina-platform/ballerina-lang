NAME
       ballerina-new - Create a new Ballerina package

SYNOPSIS
       bal new <package-path>
       bal new <package-path> [-t |--template] <template-name>


DESCRIPTION
       Create a new directory and initialize a Ballerina package inside
       that directory.

       A Ballerina package is a collection of logically-related Ballerina modules that
       are versioned and shared as a single unit. All modules of the package share the
       same 'Ballerina.toml' file and the 'target' directory.

       The package directory will have the structure below.
            .
            ├── Ballerina.toml
            └── main.bal

       Any directory becomes a Ballerina package if that directory has a
       'Ballerina.toml' file. It contains the organization name, package name,
       and the version. It also enables dependency management across the package.
       The package root directory is the default module directory.

       The 'modules' directory contains other non-default Ballerina modules. Use
       'bal add <module-name>' command to create modules.

       The 'target' directory is created during the build process. It is the output directory, 
       which contains the build artifacts.

       A template can also be specified when creating a new package. If a template is not 
       specified, this command creates a package with a 'main' template.


       OPTIONS
            -t <template-name>, --template <template-name>
                Create a package using a predefined template.

                 There are three built-in templates named:
                 1. `main`
                 2. `service`
                 3. `lib`

       EXAMPLES
            Create a package with the 'main' function.
               $ bal new <package-name>

            Create a package with the 'main' function with tests.
               $ bal new <package-name> -t main

            Create a package with a Ballerina service.
               $ bal new <package-name> -t service

            Create a package with a Ballerina library.
               $ bal new <package-name> -t lib
