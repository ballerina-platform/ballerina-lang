NAME
       ballerina-run - Compile and run the current package

SYNOPSIS
       bal run [OPTIONS] [<package>|<source-file>|<jar-file>] [--] <args...>


DESCRIPTION
       Compile the current package and run it. This command does not produce
       an executable program.

       The `run` command executes the program when a JAR file produced by
       'bal build' is given as the argument. If not, compiles and runs the given
       package or .bal file.

       A Ballerina program consists of one or more modules; one of these modules
       is distinguished as the root module, which is the default module of
       current package.

       Ballerina program execution consists of two consecutive phases.
       The initialization phase initializes all modules of a program one after
       another. If a module defines a function named 'init()', it will be
       invoked during this phase. If the root module of the program defines a
       public function named 'main()', then it will be invoked.

       If the initialization phase of program execution completes successfully,
       then execution proceeds to the listening phase. If there are no module
       listeners, then the listening phase immediately terminates successfully.
       Otherwise, the listening phase initializes the module listeners.

       A service declaration is the syntactic sugar for creating a service object
       and attaching it to the module listener specified in the service
       declaration.

       Note: Running individual '.bal' files of a package is not allowed.


OPTIONS
       --debug <port>
           Run in the remote debugging mode.

       --observability-included
           Include the dependencies that are required to enable observability.

       --offline
           Proceed without accessing the network. Attempt to proceed with the
           previously downloaded dependencies in local caches, will fail
           otherwise.

       --sticky
       	   Attempt to stick to the dependency versions available in the
       	   'Dependencies.toml' file. If the file doesn't exist, this option
       	   is ignored.

       --target-dir <path>
           Target directory path. The directory path can be absolute or relative
           to the current package.


ARGUMENTS
       --
           The '--' argument signals the end of the bal tool options
           Arguments following '--' are treated as arguments to the program.

       args...
           The list of command-line arguments for the Ballerina program.


EXAMPLES
       Run the 'main' function and service(s) in the 'app.bal' file.
           $ bal run app.bal

       Run the 'main' function and service(s) in the `app` executable JAR.
           $ bal run app.jar

       Run the 'main' function and service(s) in the current package.
           $ bal run

       Run the 'main' function in the current package with three program args:
       add, 10, and 5.
           $ bal run -- add 10 5
