NAME
       ballerina-test - Run package tests

SYNOPSIS
       bal test [OPTIONS] [<package>|<source-file>] [(-Ckey=value)...]
               

DESCRIPTION
       Compiles and executes test functions and prints a summary of
       the test results.

       Test runs the test functions defined in each module of a package when
       building the current package. It runs the test functions defined in the
       given source file when building a single '.bal' file.

       Note: Testing individual '.bal' files of a package is not allowed.


OPTIONS
       --code-coverage
           Enable code coverage. This will analyze the line coverage of the
           source `.bal` files in the Ballerina package and add a section
           to the test report with the code coverage details. This feature is
           not supported with standalone Ballerina file executions.

       --coverage-format
           Generate a coverage report in the specified format. Only
           'xml' format is supported.

       --debug <port>
           Run in the remote debugging mode.

       --disable-groups <test_group, ...>
           Specify the test groups to be excluded.

       --groups <test_group, ...>
           Specify the test groups to be executed.

       --list-groups
           List the test groups available in the test files.

       --observability-included
           Include the dependencies that are required to enable observability.

       --offline
           Proceed without accessing the network. Attempt to proceed with the
           previously downloaded dependencies in local caches,
           will fail otherwise.

       --sticky
       	   Attempt to stick to the dependency versions available in the
       	   'Dependencies.toml' file. If the file doesn't exist, this option is
       	   ignored.

       --rerun-failed
           Execute only the test cases in the packages that failed in the
           previous run.

       --target-dir <path>
           Target directory path.

       --tests <test_function_name, ...>
           Specify the test functions to be executed. A specific set of test
           functions can be executed using this command.

       --tests <FullyQualifiedModuleName>:<test_function_name, ...>
           Specify the test functions to be executed only from the given
           module. The fully qualified module name for the default module is
           <PackageName>.
           For other modules, it is <PackageName>.<ModuleDirectoryName>.
           Wildcards can be used to specify the set of functions to be executed.

       --test-report
           Generate an HTML report containing the test results.

       --native
           Execute test cases using the GraalVM native image. Native image testing
           is an experimental feature which supports only a limited set of
           functionality.

       --excludes
            Exclude a specific Ballerina source files or folders from code coverage
            calculation by providing a comma-separated list of file paths. Path can be relative
            to the package directory or absolute. Use the '*' character to match all source files
            within a single directory level, without traversing into sub-directories.
            Use the '**' character to extend the traversal to the sub-directories.
            For the complete list of supported patterns,

ARGUMENTS
       (-Ckey=value)...
           The list of configurable variables for the Ballerina program.


EXAMPLES
       Run all the test functions in the current package.
           $ bal test

       Run all test cases using the GraalVM native image.
           $ bal test --native

       List all the test groups in the current package.
           $ bal test --list-groups

       Run only the set of test functions belonging to the `group_x` in the
       current package.
           $ bal test --groups group_x

       Run only the given set of test functions in the current package.
           $ bal test --tests testFunction

       Run only the given set of test functions in the default module.
           $ bal test --tests PackageName:testName1,testName2*

       Run all the test functions in the given module.
           $ bal test --tests PackageName.ModuleName:*

       Run only the previously-failed test functions in the current package.
           $ bal test --rerun-failed

           $ bal test --test-report

       Run the tests with the code coverage.
           $ bal test --code-coverage

       Run the test functions with the code coverage and generate a test report
       with test statuses and code coverage information.
           $ bal test --test-report --code-coverage

       report in the XML format.
           $ bal test --test-report --code-coverage --coverage-format=xml

       Run the tests with the code coverage with files excluded from coverage
       calculation.

       Run the test functions with values provided for configurable variables:
           $ bal test -Cval1=add -Cval2=10 -Cval3=5
