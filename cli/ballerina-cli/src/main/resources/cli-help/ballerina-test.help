NAME
       ballerina-test - Run package tests

SYNOPSIS
       bal test [OPTIONS] [<package>|<source-file>] [(-Ckey=value)...]
               

DESCRIPTION
       Compiles and executes test functions and prints a summary of
       the test results.

       Test runs the test functions defined in each module of a package when
       building the current package. It runs the test functions defined in the
       given source file when building a single '.bal' file.

       Note: Testing individual '.bal' files of a package is not allowed.


OPTIONS
       --code-coverage
           Enable code coverage. This will analyze the line coverage of the
           source `.bal` files in the Ballerina package and add a section
           to the test report with the code coverage details. This feature is
           not supported with standalone Ballerina file executions.

       --coverage-format
           Generate a coverage report in the specified format. Only
           'xml' format is supported.

       --debug <port>
           Run in the remote debugging mode.

       --disable-groups <test_group, ...>
           Specify the test groups to be excluded.

       --groups <test_group, ...>
           Specify the test groups to be executed.

       --list-groups
           List the test groups available in the test files.

       --observability-included
           Include the dependencies that are required to enable observability.

       --offline
           Proceed without accessing the network. Attempt to proceed with the
           previously downloaded dependencies in local caches,
           will fail otherwise.

       --sticky
       	   Attempt to stick to the dependency versions available in the
       	   'Dependencies.toml' file. If the file doesn't exist, this option is
       	   ignored.

       --rerun-failed
           Execute only the test cases in the packages that failed in the
           previous run.

       --target-dir <path>
           Target directory path.

       --tests <test_function_name, ...>
           Specify the test functions to be executed. A specific set of test
           functions can be executed using this command.

       --tests <FullyQualifiedModuleName>:<test_function_name, ...>
           Specify the test functions to be executed only from the given
           module. The fully qualified module name for the default module is
           <PackageName>.
           For other modules, it is <PackageName>.<ModuleDirectoryName>.
           Wildcards can be used to specify the set of functions to be executed.

       --test-report
           Generate an HTML report containing the test results.

       --graalvm
           Execute test cases using the GraalVM native image. Native image testing
           is an experimental feature which supports only a limited set of
           functionality.

       --excludes
            Exclude a specific Ballerina source files or folders from code coverage
            calculation by providing a comma-separated list of file paths. Path can be relative
            to the package directory or absolute. Use the '*' character to match all source files
            within a single directory level, without traversing into sub-directories.
            Use the '**' character to extend the traversal to the sub-directories.
            For the complete list of supported patterns,
            see https://ballerina.io/learn/test-ballerina-code/execute-tests/#generate-test-report-and-code-coverage.

       --graalvm-build-options
            Additional build options to be passed to the GraalVM native image.

       --parallel
            Enable parallel execution of tests. A test should satisfy the following conditions to be
            executed in parallel:
                - Test function should be isolated.
                - If it is a data provider test,
                    - The data provider of a test function should be isolated.
                    - Test function parameters should be read-only type.
                - Respective set-up, and tear-down functions (before, after, before-each, after-each, before-groups,
                  after-groups) of the test function should be isolated.
            Parallel test execution is an experimental feature which supports only a limited set of functionality.
