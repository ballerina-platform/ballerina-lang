NAME
       ballerina-test - Run package tests

SYNOPSIS
       bal test [<options>] [<ballerina-file-path> | <ballerina-package-path>]


DESCRIPTION
       Test compiles and executes Ballerina test sources and prints a summary of
       test results. You can execute tests in a Ballerina package or a standalone
       Ballerina file.
    
       Use 'bal test to execute tests in the current package.

       Use 'bal test <balfile>' to execute the given Ballerina test file.
              Note that testing single `.bal` files that belongs to a Ballerina package is not allowed.
              File path can be relative or absolute.


OPTIONS
       --offline
           When building a package, the remote repository (Ballerina Central) is
           always checked for latest artifacts of the dependencies. If the
           '--offline' option is specified, this remote check is not done and
           the local artifacts will be used instead.

       --list-groups
           Lists the test groups available in the test files. Groups are
           tags that are added to test functions. They are used to
           control the execution of test functions by specifying a
           group or a set of groups that need to be executed in a test
           run. A test function can be grouped using the 'groups' parameter within the
           '@test:Config' annotation.

       --groups <test_group, ...>
           Specifies the test groups to be executed. Groups are tags that are
           added to test functions. They are used to control the
           execution of test functions by specifying a group or a set of
           groups that need to be executed in a test run. A test
           function can be grouped using the 'groups' parameter within the
           '@test:Config' annotation.

       --disable-groups <test_group, ...>
           Specifies the test groups to be excluded. Groups are tags that are
           added to test functions. They are used to control the
           execution of test functions by specifying a group or a set of
           groups that need to be executed in a test run. A test
           function can be grouped using the 'groups' parameter within the
           '@test:Config' annotation.

       --tests <test_function_name, ...>
            Specifies the test functions to be executed. A specific set of
            test functions can be executed using this command.

       --tests <PackageName>:<test_function_name, ...>
            Specifies the test functions to be executed from the default
            module only. Wildcards can be used to specify the set of functions to be executed.

       --tests <PackageName>.<ModuleName>:<test_function_name, ...>
            Specifies the test functions to be executed from the given
            module only. Wildcards can be used to specify the set of functions to be executed.

       --rerun-failed
            Executes only the previously-failed test cases in the package.

       --code-coverage
           Enables code coverage. This will analyze the line coverage of
           source `.bal` files in the Ballerina package and add a section
           to the testerina report with code coverage details.
           This feature is not supported with single file executions.

       --test-report
           Generates an HTML report containing test results.

       --coverage-format
            Generates a coverage report in specified format. Only the value 'xml' is allowed.

       --experimental
           Enable experimental language features.

       --debug
           Run tests in remote debugging mode.

       --observability-included
           Package observability in the executable.
