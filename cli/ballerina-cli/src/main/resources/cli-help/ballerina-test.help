DESCRIPTION
       Compile and execute Ballerina test sources and print a summary of
       the test results. You can execute tests in a Ballerina package or a 
       standalone Ballerina file.
    
       Use `bal test` to execute the tests in the current package.

       Use `bal test <balfile>` to execute the given Ballerina test file.
              
       Note: Testing single `.bal` files, which belong to a Ballerina 
       package is not allowed.
              
       The file path can be relative or absolute.


OPTIONS
       --offline
           Build offline using the local artifacts without downloading 
           the latest artifacts of the dependencies from the remote 
           repository (Ballerina Central).

       --list-groups
           List the test groups available in the test files. Groups are
           tags that are added to the test functions. They are used to
           control the execution of the test functions by specifying a
           group or a set of groups that need to be executed in a test
           run. A test function can be grouped using the 'groups' 
           parameter within the '@test:Config' annotation.

       --groups <test_group, ...>
           Specify the test groups to be executed. Groups are tags that are
           added to the test functions. They are used to control the
           execution of the test functions by specifying a group or a set of
           groups that need to be executed in a test run. A test
           function can be grouped using the 'groups' parameter within the
           '@test:Config' annotation.

       --disable-groups <test_group, ...>
           Specify the test groups to be excluded. Groups are tags that are
           added to the test functions. They are used to control the
           execution of the test functions by specifying a group or a set of
           groups that need to be executed in a test run. A test
           function can be grouped using the 'groups' parameter within the
           '@test:Config' annotation.

       --tests <test_function_name, ...>
           Specify the test functions to be executed. A specific set of
           test functions can be executed using this command.

       --tests <PackageName>:<test_function_name, ...>
           Specify the test functions to be executed only from the default
           module. Wildcards can be used to specify the set of functions 
           to be executed.

       --tests <PackageName>.<ModuleName>:<test_function_name, ...>
           Specify the test functions to be executed only from the given
           module. Wildcards can be used to specify the set of functions 
           to be executed.

       --rerun-failed
           Execute only the previously-failed test cases in the package.

       --code-coverage
           Enable code coverage. This will analyze the line coverage of
           source `.bal` files in the Ballerina package and add a section
           to the testerina report with the code coverage details.
           This feature is not supported with single BAL file executions.

       --test-report
           Generate an HTML report containing the test results.

       --coverage-format
           Generate a coverage report in the specified format. Only the 
           'xml' value is allowed.

       --experimental
           Enable the experimental language features.

       --debug
           Run test functions in remote debugging mode.

       --observability-included
           Include the dependencies and artifacts in the  executable JAR file(s) of a 
           Ballerina program that are required to enable the observability functionalities on it.

       --target-dir
           Target directory path.


EXAMPLES
        Run all the test functions in the current package.
           $ bal test

        List all the test groups in the current package.
           $ bal test --list-groups

        Run only the set of test functions belonging to the `group_x` in the current package.
           $ bal test --groups group_x

        Run only the given set of test functions in the current package.
            $ bal test --tests testFunction

        Run only the given set of test functions in the default module.
            $ bal test --tests PackageName:testName1,testName2*

        Run all the test functions in the given module.
