NAME
       ballerina-pack - Create distribution format of the current package

SYNOPSIS
       bal pack [OPTIONS] [<package>]


DESCRIPTION
       Compiles and packages the current package into a '.bala' file and writes
       it to the 'target/bala' directory.


OPTIONS
       --offline
           Proceed without accessing the network. Attempt to proceed with the
           previously downloaded dependencies in local caches, will fail
           otherwise.

       --sticky
       	   Attempt to stick to the dependency versions available in the
       	   'Dependencies.toml' file. If the file doesn't exist, this option is
       	   ignored.

       --target-dir
           Target directory path.

       --show-dependency-diagnostics
           Print the diagnostics that are related to the dependencies. By default, these
           diagnostics are not printed to the console.

       --optimize-dependency-compilation
           [EXPERIMENTAL] Enables memory-efficient compilation of package dependencies
           using separate processes. This can help prevent out-of-memory issues during
           the initial compilation with a clean central cache.


EXAMPLES
       Pack the current package into .bala file.
           $ bal pack
