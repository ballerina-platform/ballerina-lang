NAME
       ballerina-deprecate - Deprecates a published package

SYNOPSIS
       bal deprecate [OPTIONS] <package>


DESCRIPTION
       The deprecate command marks the specified package as deprecated in Ballerina central.

       A deprecated package will not be used as a dependency of a package unless the deprecated package is already recorded in
       the `Dependencies.toml` and the `--sticky` option is used to build the package. Also, a deprecated package will be used as
       a dependency of a package if there are no other versions that can satisfy dependency constraints.

       A warning diagnostic will be issued whenever a deprecated package is used as a dependency.

       This command does not delete the package from Ballerina central, and the package can be undeprecated using the `--undo` option.


OPTIONS
       --message=<msg>
           Use the given <msg> as the deprecation message
       --undo
           Undeprecate a deprecated package

EXAMPLES

       Deprecates the package ballerina/io:1.1.1
            bal deprecate ballerina/io:1.1.1
