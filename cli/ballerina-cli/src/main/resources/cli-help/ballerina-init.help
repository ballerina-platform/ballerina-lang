NAME
       ballerina-init - Create a new Ballerina package inside the current directory

SYNOPSIS
       bal init
       bal init <package-name>


DESCRIPTION
       Initialize a Ballerina package inside the current directory.

       A Ballerina package is a collection of logically-related Ballerina modules that
       are versioned and shared as a single unit. All modules of the package share the
       same 'Ballerina.toml' and the 'target' directory.

       The package directory will have the structure below.
            .
            ├── Ballerina.toml
            └── main.bal

       Any directory becomes a Ballerina package if that directory has a
       'Ballerina.toml' file. It contains the organization name, package name,
       and the version. It also enables dependency management across the package.
       The package root directory is the default module directory.

       The 'modules' directory contains other non-default Ballerina modules. Use
       the 'bal add <module-name>' command to create modules.

       The 'target' directory is created during the build process. It is the output directory, 
       which contains the build artifacts.


EXAMPLES
     Initialise a package.
        $ bal init
        $ bal init <package-name>
