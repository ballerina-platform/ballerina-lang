SYNOPSIS
       bal [-v | --version]
       bal help
       bal <command> [-h | --help]


DESCRIPTION
       Ballerina is a statically-typed, concurrent programming language focusing on network 
       interaction and structured data. It is intended to be the core of a language-centric 
       middleware platform. It not only has all the general-purpose functionality expected 
       from a modern programming language but also has several unusual aspects that make it
       particularly suitable for its intended purpose.
