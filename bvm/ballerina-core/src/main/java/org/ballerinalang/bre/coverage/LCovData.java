 * SOURCE: http://ltp.sourceforge.net/coverage/lcov/geninfo.1.php
 *
 *        Following  is  a  quick  description of the tracefile format as used by
 *        genhtml, geninfo and lcov.
 *
 *        A tracefile is made up of several human-readable lines of text, divided
 *        into sections. If available, a tracefile begins with the testname which
 *        is stored in the following format:
 *
 *          TN:<test name>
 *
 *        For each source file referenced in the .da file,  there  is  a  section
 *        containing filename and coverage data:
 *
 *          SF:<absolute path to the source file>
 *
 *        Following is a list of line numbers for each function name found in the
 *        source file:
 *
 *          FN:<line number of function start>,<function name>
 *
 *        Next, there is a list of execution counts for each  instrumented  func‐
 *        tion:
 *
 *          FNDA:<execution count>,<function name>
 *
 *        This  list  is followed by two lines containing the number of functions
 *        found and hit:
 *
 *          FNF:<number of functions found>
 *          FNH:<number of function hit>
 *
 *        Branch coverage information is stored which one line per branch:
 *
 *          BRDA:<line number>,<block number>,<branch number>,<taken>
 *
 *        Block number and branch number are gcc internal  IDs  for  the  branch.
 *        Taken  is either '-' if the basic block containing the branch was never
 *        executed or a number indicating how often that branch was taken.
 *
 *        Branch coverage summaries are stored in two lines:
 *
 *          BRF:<number of branches found>
 *          BRH:<number of branches hit>
 *
 *        Then there is a list of execution counts  for  each  instrumented  line
 *        (i.e. a line which resulted in executable code):
 *
 *          DA:<line number>,<execution count>[,<checksum>]
 *
 *        Note  that  there  may be an optional checksum present for each instru‐
 *        mented line. The current geninfo implementation uses  an  MD5  hash  as
 *        checksumming algorithm.
 *
 *        At  the  end of a section, there is a summary about how many lines were
 *        found and how many were actually instrumented:
 *
 *          LH:<number of lines with a non-zero execution count>
 *          LF:<number of instrumented lines>
 *
 *        Each sections ends with:
 *
 *          end_of_record
 *
 *        In addition to the main source code file there  are  sections  for  all
 *        #included files which also contain executable code.
 *
 *        Note that the absolute path of a source file is generated by interpret‐
 *        ing the contents of the respective .bb file  (see  gcov  (1)  for  more
 *        information  on  this  file type). Relative filenames are prefixed with
 *        the directory in which the .bb file is found.
 *
 *        Note also that symbolic links to the .bb file will be resolved so  that
 *        the  actual  file  path  is  used  instead  of the path to a link. This
 *        approach is necessary for the mechanism to  work  with  the  /proc/gcov
 *        files.
