// Ballerina provides the capability to easily introduce WebSub compliant publishers and subscribers.
// Ballerina WebSub subscribers can specify the topic they wish to subscribe to and the hub they wish to subscribe at
// to receive notifications, and the subscription process would be initiated at start up if specified. Subscribers
// receiving authenticated content distribution, can also make use of default signature validation available. Ballerina
// WebSub Subscriber Services could thus be registered as webhooks to receive event notifications.
// Ballerina also comes with an in-built WebSub Hub service that can be brought up by publishers who require bringing
// up a hub.
// This sample demonstrates a simple WebSub publisher and subscriber scenario, where the publisher publishes to the
// internal hub it brings up both directly and considering it as a remote service.
