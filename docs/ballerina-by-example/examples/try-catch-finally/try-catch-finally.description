//Throwing an error generally means an unexpected error has happend, and the code that handles the thrown error is not
//expected to be able to do much to recover from it, rather than perhaps catch and log it.
//Throwing errors will be very rare and will happen under exceptional circumstances such as server going out of memory,
//running out of disk space.
