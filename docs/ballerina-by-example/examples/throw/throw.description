//In Ballerina, throwing an error means, something unexpected has happened
//that shouldn’t occur during the normal operation. A thrown error? causes
//the call stack to be unwound until a matching catcher is found.

//Ballerina encourages developers, NOT to use 'throw' for handling program related
//errors (i.e header not found, Data mismatched error etc), but in an error situation
//where it couldn't handle the error by itself, like accessing a Null Reference,
//Connection Closed/TimeOut and OutOfMemory etc.
