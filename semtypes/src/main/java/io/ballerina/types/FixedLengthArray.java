/**
 * Represent a fixed length semtype member list similar to a tuple.
 * The length of the list is `fixedLength`, the last member of the `initial` is repeated to achieve this semantic.
 * { initial: [int], fixedLength: 3, } is same as { initial: [int, int, int], fixedLength: 3 }
 * { initial: [string, int], fixedLength: 100 } means `int` is repeated 99 times to get a list of 100 members.
 * `fixedLength` must be `0` when `inital` is empty and the `fixedLength` must be at least `initial.length()`
 *
