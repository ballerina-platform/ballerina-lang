/**
 * Lcov formatted coverage data holder.
 *
 * @since 0.985.0
 *
 * <p>
 * SOURCE: http://ltp.sourceforge.net/coverage/lcov/geninfo.1.php
 * <p>
 * Following  is  a  quick  description of the tracefile format as used by
 * genhtml, geninfo and lcov.
 * <p>
 * * A tracefile is made up of several human-readable lines of text, divided
 * into sections. If available, a tracefile begins with the testname which
 * is stored in the following format:
 * <p>
 * TN:&lt;test name&gt;
 * <p>
 * For each source file referenced in the .da file,  there  is  a  section
 * containing filename and coverage data:
 * <p>
 * SF:&lt;absolute path to the source file&gt;
 * <p>
 * Following is a list of line numbers for each function name found in the
 * source file:
 * <p>
 * FN:&lt;line number of function start&gt;,&lt;function name&gt;
 * <p>
 * Next, there is a list of execution counts for each  instrumented  func‐
 * tion:
 * <p>
 * FNDA:&lt;execution count&gt;,&lt;function name&gt;
 * <p>
 * This  list  is followed by two lines containing the number of functions
 * found and hit:
 * <p>
 * FNF:&lt;number of functions found&gt;
 * FNH:&lt;number of function hit&gt;
 * <p>
 * Branch coverage information is stored which one line per branch:
 * <p>
 * BRDA:&lt;line number&gt;,&lt;block number&gt;,&lt;branch number&gt;,&lt;taken&gt;
 * <p>
 * Block number and branch number are gcc internal  IDs  for  the  branch.
 * Taken  is either '-' if the basic block containing the branch was never
 * executed or a number indicating how often that branch was taken.
 * <p>
 * Branch coverage summaries are stored in two lines:
 * <p>
 * BRF:&lt;number of branches found&gt;
 * BRH:&lt;number of branches hit&gt;
 * <p>
 * Then there is a list of execution counts  for  each  instrumented  line
 * (i.e. a line which resulted in executable code):
 * <p>
 * DA:&lt;line number&gt;,&lt;execution count&gt;[,&lt;checksum&gt;]
 * <p>
 * Note  that  there  may be an optional checksum present for each instru‐
 * mented line. The current geninfo implementation uses  an  MD5  hash  as
 * checksumming algorithm.
 * <p>
 * At  the  end of a section, there is a summary about how many lines were
 * found and how many were actually instrumented:
 * <p>
 * LH:&lt;number of lines with a non-zero execution count&gt;
 * LF:&lt;number of instrumented lines&gt;
 * <p>
 * Each sections ends with:
 * <p>
 * end_of_record
 * <p>
 * In addition to the main source code file there  are  sections  for  all
 * #included files which also contain executable code.
 * <p>
 * Note that the absolute path of a source file is generated by interpret‐
 * ing the contents of the respective .bb file  (see  gcov  (1)  for  more
 * information  on  this  file type). Relative filenames are prefixed with
 * the directory in which the .bb file is found.
 * <p>
 * Note also that symbolic links to the .bb file will be resolved so  that
 * the  actual  file  path  is  used  instead  of the path to a link. This
 * approach is necessary for the mechanism to  work  with  the  /proc/gcov
 * files.
