If not, then an error is returned.  \nThe `constructFrom` operation is recursively applied to each member of `v` using  \nthe type descriptor that the inherent type requires for that member.  \n  \nLike the Clone abstract operation, this does a deep copy, but differs in  \nthe following respects:  \n- the inherent type of any structural values constructed comes from the specified  \n  type descriptor rather than the value being constructed  \n- the graph structure of `v` is not preserved; the result will always be a tree;  \n  an error will be returned if `v` has cycles  \n- immutable structural values are copied rather being returned as is; all  \n  structural values in the result will be mutable, except for error values  \n  (which are always immutable)  \n- numeric values can be converted using the NumericConvert abstract operation  \n- if a record type descriptor specifies default values, these will be used  \n  to supply any missing members  \n  \n"
