Note: You can right click on the file and run the main method as well.

### Running Ballerina services

This is similar to running main functions. Near the service definition, in the gutter area, **Run** icon can be found. Clicking on this **Run** icon, available commands can be viewed. Select **Run** command. This will start the service and show the output in the **Run** window. Please note that running a Ballerina file with few services will start all services in that file.
