/**
 * The {@code NodeVisitor} visits each node in the syntax tree allowing
 * us to do something at each node.
 * <p>
 * This class separates tree nodes from various unrelated operations that needs
 * to be performed on the syntax tree nodes.
 * <p>
 * {@code NodeVisitor} is a abstract class that itself visits the complete
 * tree. Subclasses have the ability to override only the required visit methods.
 * <p>
 * There exists a visit method for each node in the Ballerina syntax tree.
 * These methods return void. If you are looking for a visitor that has visit
 * methods that returns something, see {@link NodeTransformer}.
 *
 * This is a generated class.
