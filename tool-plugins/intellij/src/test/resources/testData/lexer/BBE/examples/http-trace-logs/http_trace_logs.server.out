# Trace logs are logged at `TRACE` level. 
# To enable trace logs, the log level has to be set to `TRACE` using the runtime argument: <br> '-e b7a.http.tracelog.console=true'. <br>
# At the command line, navigate to the directory that contains the 
# `.bal` file and run the `ballerina run` command with this runtime argument. 
$ ballerina run http_trace_logs.bal -e b7a.http.tracelog.console=true
ballerina: HTTP trace log enabled
ballerina: initiating service(s) in 'http_trace_logs.bal'
ballerina: started HTTP/WS server connector 0.0.0.0:9090
# In the logs, `http.downstream` refers to the HTTP traffic that flows between the client and Ballerina, 
# while `http.upstream` refers to the HTTP traffic that flows between Ballerina and the backend.

# In the log record, 'id' refers to the ID of the channel between Ballerina and the remote host (either a backend service, or a client).
# In cases where Ballerina is in the middle (like in this example), the upstream traffic logs include a 'correlatedSource' in addition to the channel ID.
# This refers to the downstream channel ID of a connection to a client whose request resulted in the upstream connection to the backend.
# The correlated source ID is included in the upstream HTTP traffic logs. It can be used to filter out both downstream and upstream traffic of a connection with a client.
